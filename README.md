# CLRS-Introduction-to-Algorithm
**Note:** This project will be continually updated and I sure hope that you enjoy what you see in this repository. But please note that you might find things that you would think it must be optimized or even the code can be condensed in a manner that would be more readable and efficient. And you need to know that I am doing these projects just to show case my capabilities for the recruiters of the jobs that I am currently applying to. Best of wishes to whoever read this and if you enjoyed what you saw here, please don't hesitate to contact me on my LinkedIn account [LinkedIn Account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashidalazzoni/).

This repository will contain three projects that I am currently working on, in order to enhance my capabilities and to prevent my learning from stagnating due to my current situation of unemployment. The three projects that I worked on in this repository are algorithms that I learned from the Introduction to Algorithms book, full stack web development, and consistent training on problem solving.

The first project, as was mentioned before, deals with algorithms from the Introduction to Algorithms book which is commonly referred to as CLRS. I am studying this book by following the outline given in the [MIT 6.006 course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm).Unfortunately, because  y bachelor's degree was in Electronics engineering, I didn't have the opportunity to learn what computer scientists studies, but as they say better than never ;). Nevertheless, it is very intriguing to study from the CLRS book and it is very interesting to see the major impact of asymptotic complexity analysis on the technology advancement and statistical analysis. I have tried to implement many of the data structures and algorithms that were discussed in this book in C++ by utilizing gdb  as my debugger in my Linux virtual machine.

The second project is dealing with full stack web development, and to be honest with you during my undergraduate studies I didn't find web development as an interesting subject. But now-a-days with the influx of all kinds of frame works --- from the like of React, Angular, Flask and Django--- it became a crucial thing to get acquainted with variety of tools that we might need at our disposal in our day-to-day work. So, I have decided to embark in this journey to learn web development using Flask, Django and React, and I really wasn't disappointed in this journey and I am quite happy with the information that I got to learn in this journey. This project will focus mainly on designing websites using React, d3, Flask, and Django.

The third project will be dealing with problem solving in which I will try to solve as many problems as humanly possible to solve. In which I will mainly deal with problems that I find in  [leet Code](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/).
