# Chat App using Node and Express server

This project utilized node as the server in the backend side, and used Express.js as the framework for controlling the end points, and used Socket.io to enable chatting between different users.

## Run the following command in the command line interface:

### npm run start

## If the server didn't start then you might need to install the packages that you can find in the packages.json file. If everything worked out, go to your favorite browser and search for http://127.0.0.1:3000/
